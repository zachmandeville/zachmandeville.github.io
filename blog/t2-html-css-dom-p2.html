	<h1>HTML, CSS, and DOM Reflections: pt. 2</h1>
	<p>These are my continued reflections on our Udacity tutorials, built around the prompts
	given!</p>
	<h2>What is Grid Based Design?</h2>
	<p>GBD is a continuation of the boxifying introduced in part 1.  If the entire website is a
	series of boxes, then you can use pleasant math to better arrange these boxes.  By seeing
	the site as one big grid, that can be broken into 1/12's, 1/2's, and 1/4's, you can make
	nice layouts as easily as you'd layout a newspaper or zine.  So you create rows, and column
	class tags (along with a grid flex tag) and then use these to make layouts that follow a
	predictable and consistent structure.</p>
	<h2>What is all the hype about Responsive Design?</h2>
	<p>Responsive Design is the acknowledgement that you should make your web pages for
	everyone, but that everyone uses different kinds of screens.  We are no longer in a world
	where everyone has a home desktop with a specifically sized monitor, and you can create html
	for just that browser.  Now, folks will be visiting your site through their phones, their
	tablets, their raspberry pi's connected to a salvaged gamegear screen, etc.  Responsive
	Design is a method to make sure the important aspects of yoru page are visible no matter the
	screen through which someone views them.</p>
	<p>From a humanist/progressive perspective, responsive design is important because desktop
	screens assume a class privilege.  Many people only have access to the web through their
	phones, especially in developing countries.  By designing for these situations, you can
	ensure that your site is accessible to all regardless of class or means.</p>
	<p>sidenote:  this is explored in depth in the wonderful site: <a

	<h2>What is Semantic Structure?</h2>
	<p>Semantic structure is a philosophy/method for structuring the bare HTML of your webpage,
	so that it's design can be read by humans as easily as it's read by machines.  This comes
	from having clear titles for your tags like h1, h2, p, etc.--and using them as their names
	imply (so like doing use the h1 tag to surround an image.)  Semantic also means detaching
	the style of the page from the structure of the page.  By having an external stylesheeet
	that holds the layout instructions, instead of placing them inline to the html tag, you can
	better ensure that someone can read the content of your site in an accessible way regardless
	of what their browser can handle (if a browser doesn't udnerstand what your class means,
	it'll just ignore it, but still display the raw html.  So if the raw html is semantically
	structured, it will be readable without any fancy classes.)
	<h2>Any Other Points you find interesting?</h2>
	<p>The latter half of the Udacity tutorial introduced a couple conventions that I found
	kinda worrying: using google for your fonts and for normalizing your CSS.  It's worrying to
	me for a couple reasons: 
	<ol>
	    <li><b>It creates an unnecessary dependency on other companies</b>
		<p>If your font only exists on another site, that is being called when the page is
		loaded, then you need that site to be up for your font to load.  To me, this makes
		the entire site more fragile and could potentially cause it to not load (or load
		slowly).  It also means you have a vested interest in some other company or server
		staying functional, and when that company is problematic then it puts an unpleasant
		dynamic upon your site.  Google is big enough that it'll stay online for a while,
		but if you start to rely upon site upon site upon site for your frameworks, fonts,
		placeholders, etc. then if on aspect of them shuts down your entire site is
		affected.  I'm not keen on that.</p>
	    <li><b>It's establishing a relationship that your site visitor is not aware of (and may
		    disagree with).</b>
		<p>Your site visitor is coming to <em>your site</em>, and assumes they are only
		interacting then with you.  But if you are building your site based on things
		imported from other companies, then these companies are also being made aware of
		your visitor--and may have their own designs upon them.  This is less worrying with
		CSS, but becomes a huge issue with javascript as it allows these companies to track
		people who may not want to be tracked(and are often not aware they <em>are</em>
		being tracked).  We have a responsibility to be upfront and caring to our visitors,
		including maintaining their privacy and dignity.</p>
	</ol>
