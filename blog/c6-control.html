	    <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers?</h2>
	    <p>Documentation.  Or rather, the lack of it or the dismissive tone of it.</p>
	    <p>I get frustrated during programming for a number of reasons: I forgot a curly brace,
	    or my loop isn't going all the way through and Ic an't figure out why, or I have some
	    issue with how to properly style a function so it makes sense.  These all feel good,
	    though, like semi-steep hills that I'm biking up, but can feel my thighs and calves
	    getting stronger.</p>
	    <p>Bad documentation can make me so frustrated that I stop working and have to move away
	    from my computer.  I think it's because it gives me the impression that I am not welcome
	    in this coding space.  When you are confused by what a command does, and you look it up
	    (or find the manual for it) and the answer is something like:</p>
	    <p>'this is a d8 device, which (as should be  obvious) you never fully init but instead
	    will use a variant of the classic flagged -awk command (ugly i know!)'</p>
            <p> Not only do I not get a clear answer, but the answer seems to assume some cultural
	    knowledge I don't have, plus a cultural inside joke I can't be a part of.  Since this is
	    the documentation, like the beginning help for the thing, I then assume the writer
	    believed no one but their direct peers would ever be reading this; or wanted to write it
	    in scuh a way that only their peers would read it.  This charges me up due to bigger
	    issues I have around tech culture, and the mainstream internet, and shitty white dudes,
	    and bullies.  Haha, even now I'm getting worked up and so I'ma practice the subject of
	    question two!</p>
	    <h2>How did you find the SiBeriaN RailRoad exercise </h2>
	    <p>Good!</p>
	    <p>SiBeriaN RailRoad is a mnemonic for a technique on controlling your triggers.
	    It stands for: Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond.</p>
	    <p>The exercise was tough initially because I didn't want to willfully bring up a
	    negative emotion.  This also made me self-conscious, which then put me into that
	    meta-emotion dumb spiral.  BUT!  Stopping all of this, and noticing how I was feeling
	    helped me move through.  I find the concepts of SBNRR incredibly useful beyond
	    programming.  It reminded me of a treasure of a book 'There's no Right Way to
	    Meditate'.  Being easy on ourselves first helps us be easier on others.  Kindness comes
	    from within and radiates outwards. but this means your own kindness has to move through
	    you first.<p>
