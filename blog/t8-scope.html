      <h1>t8 Scope</h1>
      <h2>Explain what 'scope' is, and how it works in a Javascript environment.</h2>
      <p>To better understand scope, we should first talk about variables.
      <p>Like many programming languages, javascript works with variables.  Variables allow
      you to define a word to be a specific value or function or string or what have you.  For
      example:</p>
      <p><code>var theCoolestThing = 'That scene in Thor Ragnarok where they're on the rainbow
	bridge and thor is covered in lightning while Led Zeppelin plays.'</code></p>
      <p>Here, I've made up a variable called <code>theCoolestThing</code> and I say that it
      represents a specific scene in Thor.  So whenever I am talking about the coolest thing, you
      know I am actually talking about Thor. In javascript, this is useful because it means
      you don't need to type the same function over and over, and you can even adjust the
      variable to have it change based on some other interaction (like having a "total" variable on your calculator app that changes based on the numbers you've entered.)</p>
      <p>You can define variables for the entire set of code (called global variable) or you can
      define a variable within a function (called a local or function variable).  Scope, then,
      refers to the extent, across yr code, in which that variable is known.  If you assign a global
      variable, then every bit of your code will know what that variable means.  If you declare a variable from within a function, though, then it's meaning is local to that function, and thus only known by it.</p>
      <p>For example, that above variable theCoolestThing is <em>well</em>-known within my household.  If I mention theCoolestThing, my wife knows exactly what I mean.  But if I were to reference that to anyone outside of my house, they would likely have no clue what I mean (or maybe have their own local definitions of that variable).  In other words, you could display the code as:</p>
      <code><pre>
      function myHouse () {
        var theCoolestThing = 'that thor scene with the bridge, zep, and lightning.'
      }</pre></code>
      <p>This is a local variable, known only to the function that is my house.</p>
      <p>Because a global variable will be known, and can be affected by, any function in your code, it is good practice to only declare a global variable when absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, you can create confusing scenarios where there's competing opinions on the meaning of that thing, which affects all other code around it.  By maintaining local meaning, you can make sure the function and all it's variables work as you intended, and are not being affected by any larger opinion.</p>
