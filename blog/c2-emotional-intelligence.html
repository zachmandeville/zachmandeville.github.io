		<h1>C2: Emotional Intelligence</h1>
		<p><em>This blog is a response to the reading of Chapter 1 of Search Inside
		    yourself</em></p>
		<p>I have a similar response to the first chapter in this book as I did to the "time and
		habit management" repo:  I love the essence of what is being said, but have resistance to
		the tone of the message.</p>
		<p>Part of this may be personal, in that I have deep apprehension, and dislike, for Google.
		The book's introduction and opening chapter is <em>very</em> fond of how cool Google is, and
		the great things originating from there.  This causes me to distrust the authority of the
		author:  if Meng has heightened his mindfulness and empathy, why does he still have such
		fondness for Google?  I realize that my view is a bit extreme, and his perspective has a
		sentimental nuance I can't  know (Google is family, home, beginning, and more so whatever
		bad qualities of his company are personally filtered through the goodness of his memory).  I
		believe Meng <em>wants</em> to mean well, and that this book is a segment in his own life, and not
		the definition of it.  I'd be interested in where he is at now.</p>
		<p>The fundamental hurdle for me in this chapter is that it positions mindfulness, and emotional
		intelligence, as tools for your own self-interest.  I want them positioned as tools' for the
		world's health, and a recognition that you are a part of this world.  Yes you can become a
		better leader which will get you promoted, but what position are you being promoted into and
		what does this mean for the community you are in?  For example, he gives a scenario where
		someone cuts you off and you have the reflex to flip them off, but you are emotionally
		mature enough to puse and think on whether you really want to flip them off, and decide
		against it.  He then says this is good because that driver could have been an old man who
		would beat you with his golf clubs before saying you were no longer able to date his
		daughter.  In other words, the benefit of not flipping someone else off is that you are not
		hurt.  In that example, it could just as easily been that the person cut you off because because they were driving
		with a bloody hand to the hospital and missed their exit, or they were being yelled at the
		passenger in the car, and were distracted with their own hurt...or any other number of scenarios.
		The benefit of not responding with anger is that you are not giving anger out into the
		world, but in this chapter it was instead 'You'll stay one step ahead of being hurt and
		maybe get yrself a new job too!'.  I know he is writing for a particular audience, and he
		may have found that he needed to temper his words to fit his audience....but I also know
		that this audience is <em>not</em> me.</p>
		<p>BUT!!!  I dont' need to respond with antagonism to this book, even if that's the initial
		feeling.  In the same way that meditation is not practiced solely on mountain tops, but also
		in crowded streets and loud subway cars...I can read through the noice of management-speak
		to get to the wonderful nuggets beneath.  Like Mindfulness meditation, and two minutes of
		breath.  And those two minutes I'll take.......now.</p>
		<p>Thoughts on Mindfulness: It was great!  The writing above made me more stressed than I
		realized, and I had tension that feels much softer now.  AND! I am remembering how happy i
		am that mindfulness and empathy are being taught first thing in my dev course, which is a
		subset of a radical and pleasant tech cooperative and not google.  All in all, I am happy to
		have read the book and to be a part of this class.</p>
