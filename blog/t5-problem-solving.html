        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
	<h2>My cool Problem Solving Story</h2>
	<p>Hello, non-tech friend!  Lemme tell you about the time I added a custom exercise section
	to a "yoga helper" I made.  This helper went through different poses and set a timer for how
	long you should do each one.  I wanted a way to put in new routines into ths helper and have
	it understand them and run them.  I knew that I didn't want this to be especially
	complicated, and had a dream that people could write out routines as like plaintext files to
	share with one another.  I had  no clue how to accomplish this.</p>
	<p>To solve the problem I did a mixture of "pseudocode" and "ask a friend".  I wrote up a
	user story of sorts, describing how I'd want someone to be able to write up a routine, give
	it to the program, and have it run properly--and that the routine was separate from the
	program.  Then, I went to a weekly computer club and asked a friend for advice. Since I'd
	worked out the general process, I was able to articulate where I was still confused and
	received better help.  My friend said to take a look at .ini files.</p>
	<p>I then searched for more info on .ini files and found out how they're written, and how
	they could be read by a program.  These work elegantly for when you're trying to have a user
	put in different sorts of configurations.  Why I loved this solution, is that this concpet
	could be used for any number of other programs too.  And so I learned another type of
	standard that could be used by multiple languages or devices, that solved my yoga app
	problem, and other problems down the road!</p>
