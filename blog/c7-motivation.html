      <h2>How does Life look from the 'pleasure, passion, purpose' lens?</h2>
      <p>Honestly: pretty good!  This is something I've believed in for a long time, and have
      spent a lot of personal time figuring out how to be patient with passions if they are
      fulfilling a larger purpose.  In other word: the things I'm doing may not make me
      immediately (or ever) famous or rich, but if they are important and fit my higher
      purpose, then it won't matter.  I am fortunate to have found passions that put me into the
      flow easily-- and coding itself is one of them.  I don't believe in denying or
      restricting pleasure-- the world is meant to be celebrated and enjoyed!  But I've
      learned to check in and ask, "does this actually feel good, or does it just appear to
      feel good?"  This helps me figure out what is good and in the flow, and what's a
      depressive inertia disguising itself as a pleasure.  This distinction requires continual
      check-ins, there is no dogmatic separation from the pleasure, passion, and purpose to me
      which is why meditation and mindfulness are so important.</p>
      <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
      <p>My core values would be kindness, empathy, pleasure, magic, and the continual
      exploration and expansion of metaphor. I think that magic is real, and you should  draw
      it out and celebrate it in all parts of your world.  A way to do
      this is through kindness to one another, and your world, and an empathy to not only
      listen to other people, but to your heart and to your surroundings and what they are
      asking for too.  And I think that none of this matters if you aren't happy like a bee
      drenched in pollen.  I believe that the world is as we describe it, and that there is an
      element to this world that we <em>can't </em> describe, which is why it's powerful.  We
      strive to explain this element as closely as we can, to use comparisons and descriptions
      to sort of describe around the thing, to better hint at it's shape.  And so continually
      expanding the words that you can speak can help you better articulate that essence that
      drives you.  The counterside of this is that denying people the ability to speak, or
      blocking the entrances to learn more languages and words, is cosmically criminal.</p>
      <h2>What do you stand for?</h2>
      <p>I stand for equality, endless generosity, the power of the intuition and the irrational,
      and the need to bring more voices and views into the technology that drives so much of our
      world.  Computers should augment our relationships and capabilities, and not limit or control
      them.  And so computer technology is a language more of us should have the ability to speak
      and alter.</p>
      <h2>How did you find the resilience and meditation exercise?</h2>
      <p>Really good, and interesting!  I found it <em>super</em> easy to recall and live in a
      failure, even though it was unpleasant.  But when I experienced the failure as physioligical
      changes, they seemed just passing and funny.  Like, my shoulders siezed up and it felt like
      there were worms crawling in my chest...but once you say 'oh, it feels like lil worms crawling
      across my chest.' you realize how easy of a feeling that is to experience.  It's a far easier
      feeling than an upset stomach, or even something inconsequential like too-spicy food or a foot that's
      asleep.  And so once the body feelings felt small, that failure felt small and passing
      too.</p>
      <p>I had a harder time staying in the moment of a success.  I could think of one, but I
      immediately felt silly just thinking about it.  So I had to really sit during those two
      minutes and be in that moment, even though the moment was a good one?  The body feeling was
      one of intense(but happy) restlessness.  I wanted to stand up, and I <em>really</em> wanted to
      speak or shout.  It felt like a ball of electricity moving up and down my body at increasing
      speed--which is pleasant, but not for a sustained period and I really wanted to let that ball
      out.</p>
