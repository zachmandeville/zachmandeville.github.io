	    <h2>What did you learn from the mindfulness conversation?</h2>o
	    <p>I used the mindfulness convo with my fiancee on the morning of our wedding, and lemme
	    tell you it HELPED.  We had a swirl of family around us, and things that needed to be done
	    for the day to go well.  We'd intentially designed our wedding to be as stress-free as
	    possible, but there was still a lot of coordination and planning we needed to do throughout
	    the day.  So in the morning we did a mindful conversation.  She had 3 minutes to talk about
	    her hopes for the day, her anxieties, what she needed, etc.  Then I spoke back to her what I
	    understood from what she said, and she clarified until we were on the same page.  Then I did
	    the same thing.  What happened, then, is we had a better understanding of what exactly we
	    needed to reduce stress, and the signals we'd send each other when we needed help.  But we
	    also started the day saying "I am wanting to listen to you and help you" and just that
	    intention helped.</p>
	    <h2>Which three methods will you continue to use?</h2>
	    <p>All of them!  I am really down with this method as it feels indistinguishable from good
	    ol' fashioned kindness.</p>
	    <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
	    <p>I am falling into the groove of Meng's tone more, and one thing that I like about his
	    "MINDHACK" technique is the notion of exercising.  In meditation, when your mind drifts and
	    you bring it back, it's not a failure because of the drifting.  Instead, you just engaged in
	    the exercise of bringing back focus.  I like that approach, as it keeps the whole experience
	    positive and an act of learning, not some <em>thing</em> you have to master.</p>
