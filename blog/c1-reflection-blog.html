		<h1>The First Entry</h1>
		<p class="date gold">1-16-18</p>
		<p>This is the first blog entry for the first sprint of my first week of Dev Academy.  I,
		excitedly, do not know what I am doing.  I want to start up this blog with no expecations
		for style or tone.  The only core value I'm holding here is honesty.  And, so, honestly:
		I'm a little tired, and self-conscious, and so this first entry will be straightforward and
		short like a clearing of the throat, helping myself express my words more clearly later.</p>
	
		<p>I just watched Shereef's fireside chat and the primary takeaway I got from it was
		<em>relief</em>.  I knew I wanted to learn how to code, and I knew that Enspiral would
		likely be the best school for this, but this video was a grand reassurance that my feelings
		were right.</p>
	
		<p>My relief comes in that I feel EDA/DBC are emphasising learning to code as a personal
		journey, a way to more fully express your self.  The tone of the video was encouragement,
		saying we should  allow ourselves to get the most from this adventure.  It was not &#8220;Do
		exactly what i say and you'll have a Ferrari by this time next year.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;Us coders are
		different from the average person, and I'm going to be as hard on you as possible to weed
		out the average poseurs from the truly leet.&#8221;  I've heard that tone so much in tech-writing,
		or the tutorials I've watched online.  This toxic tech-bro culture that turned me away from
		wanting to learn this stuff because I didn't want to become a jerk too.  Shereef and EDA are
		showing an alternate path.  Here we are watching an introductory video that essentially
		says, &#8220;You doing okay?  Listen to your body.  Be good to yourself, by expecting the most out
		of yourself.  Let's be mindful and nice to each other.&#8221;  So in terms of how I'ma approach this, it'll be with gusto and full-speed.</p>
	
		<p>I also feel like this week is introducing us to this particular style of teaching, this
		particularly vulnerable tone, more than any language or technology.  We are being told about
		git, and the command line, and HTML, but we're being told in a specific way that I'm
		starting to see is deliberate, and intentional.  That deliberate pace I wasn't necessarily
		expecting before this week, but I gotta say I like it!</p>
	
		<p>That's all, this is all good!</p>
