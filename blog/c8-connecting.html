	    <h2>Have you tried any of the trust-building, sincerity excercises?  How did it go?</h2>
	    <p>Oh, I'm all ABOUT sincerity! Sincerely!  I've done a fair amount of comedy in my life
	    working, with different groups within the city.  Before that, I had creative groups
	    around zines or music too.  In each, sincerity was required to build trust and in that
	    trust came support.  This is true with the group--being sincere in your art, and wanting
	    others to do well, helps you receive and give feedback.  This translates into stronger
	    art, and a stronger network of people to help with each other's art.  This dynamic was
	    present between the performer and audience too.  If the audience feels you are just
	    making things up, and not believing in what it is you're doing, then they will check
	    out.  Actual sincerity is how you build trust with that audience, who wants to support
	    you through a good set.  When that trust is built between auidence and performers, then
	    the show is absolutely magical.</p>
	    <p>I have not done the exact trust exercises he mentions, but have done variations of
	    them in these groups.</p>
	    <h2>Try empathic listening.  How did it go?</h2>
	    <p>Great!  My ideal is to live in a way that this style of listening is not an alien
	    practice that I need to inentionally work through.  I feel good in that empathic
	    listening did not feel much different from conversations I have with my friends and wife
	    anyway.</p>
	    <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
	    <p>Delightful!  The quality I'm enjoying in each of these exercises is how physical they
	    are--or like how there is body sensations coming from the mental journeys.  During
	    loving kindness, I could not supress my smile, and felt a sort of giddiness travelling
	    through my like static electricity.  I also found it helped adjust all my interactions,
	    not just with the person I visualized in loving kindness.  My giddiness translated to
	    how i felt with the people walking down the street with me, or waiting for their clothes
	    to dry in the laundromat.  We were all in this wonderful thing together.</p>
	    <h2>The Political Awareness Exercise</h2>
	    <h3>Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some
	      conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency
	      for you.</h3>
	    <p>The one that popped into my mind initially was a disagreement I had on my
	    second-to-last day of work.  I was the product manager of this Analytics software, and
	    the team that created and maintained it had left the company with myself leaving shortly
	    after.  So I was working to transition responsibilities to a new development team.  One
	    of these responsibilities was with terminology throughout the software.  Sometimes our
	    definitions change, or we find that the definition we used was not clear to our
	    customer.  To fix them, you would go into the code, find the field in which the
	    definition was listed, and change it.</p>
	    <p>I wanted this job to be able to be done by our upper-level support people.  The new
	    product manager refused this, though, saying that only developers should touch the code
	    and support could move through proper developer channels if they wanted to propose a
	    wording change.</p>
	    <h3>Describe the situation as if you were 100% reasonable</h3>
	    <p>Having worked with the software for a year, and having worked with the support team
	    far longer, I know what areas they are experts in and what things they are capable of.
	    I also had this belief that, working in a tech company, our support should understand
	    the tech they're working with, and so any time there's a chance to expand their
	    knowledge, we should take it as it's good for everyone.  I also knew that the
	    development team taking over did not understand the end-use of the software.  They were
	    learning the code, but not how people used it or approached it.  So they would be having
	    to turn to Support constantly to figure out what these words meant, or how customers
	    read them.  Because of this, it felt inefficient and frankly rude to not integrate
	    support more into the development of the product, to better get that customer
	    perspective at a code level.</p>
	    <h3>Describe the situation as if the other person was 100% reasonable</h3>
	    <p>We are working with technology that affects thousands of people in their day-to-day
	    operations.  We can not risk this technology going down because someone didn't
	    understand what they were doing, and changed some code they shouldn't have.  Allowing
	    someone that I do not work with directly to be within the codebase provides too strong
	    of a risk.  While I am learning this code, the best thing I can rely on is the
	    principles learned in the dev world--including the principle of least permissions.  So I
	    will use this as a guide, and provide a known channel for support to communicate with us
	    without extending breakable code to them.  This is also an area where I do not fully
	    know the code and product yet (as I'm transitioning to it) so I want the borders and
	    processes to be as bold and narrow as possible as I gain my footing.</p>
	    <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
	    <p>I have reservations against the mainstream tech world (or Silicon Valley).
	    Reservations isnt' the right word--I have deep resentment against them.  I can be
	    empathetic to people within that culture, but I worry about any empathy of that culture
	    as a whole.  The fact that empathy has to be taught to them in a book, as a way to make
	    meetings stronger and your team succeed more, doesn't really boost my feelings about
	    that culture at all.  I love mindfulness, but not when it's being given like some disgusting
	    vegetable hidden within the cheese and potatoes of a meal.  It makes me wonder why this
	    has to be translated so drastically for this crowd.</p>
