	    <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>o
	    <p>One is the definition of the other, and vice versa.  Or rather, to have good
	    self-awarness is to practice mindfulness, and proper mindfulness practice requires good
	    self-awarenes.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Try Body Scans.  How did it feel?</h2>
	    <p>It felt good, and while I was noticing each part of my body, I also found myself
	    noticing my breath much more.  I carry a lot of emotion in my shoulders, and it felt
	    like I could breathe positive emotions into them and feel them relax.  This was a good
	    practice.</p>
	    <h2>What did you take away from the 'My Emotions are Not Me' section?</h2>
	    <p>It made me think of Irish Gaelic.  In the irish language, there is no word for
	    "have".  So you don't own objects, they are just with you for a while but maintain their
	    own agency (and can be used by others).  Similarly, you do not own emotions.  When
	    someone is happy, they will say "happiness is upon me" if they are angry they'll say
	    "anger is upon me."  I adore this notion, that a mood is currently on top of you, and
	    with you, but it is not yours.  It will visit for a moment and then go away.  This
	    notion helps me with my own depressive moods!</p>
