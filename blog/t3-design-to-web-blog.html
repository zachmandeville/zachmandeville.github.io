	<h1>t3: Design to Web</h1>
	<h2>What is a responsive site, and why is it important?</h2>
	<p>A responsive site is one that 'responds' to the screen-size of the visitor of the site,
	and reacts accordingly.  And so it is optimized for phones, and desktop, and tablet, and so
	on.  There isn't one particular type of browser or device needed to view your webpage.  This
	is important, as it means you are not limiting your potential audience by something
	arbitrary like access to a computer.</p>
	<h2>What's Mobile First Design, and why is it important></h2>
	<p>Mobile first means designing your site for phone screens first, and then using media
	queries(if needed) for optimization on desktop.  It encourages you to make sure the contents
	of your site are accessible even within the most restricted screen, and then allows you to
	expand from there.  This will make it easier in the future to further expand and optimize
	your site.  By doing it for computers first, you will have a harder job trying to then scale your
	grand vision down to a phone.</p>
	<h2>What is a framework, and what are the pros and cons?</h2>
	<p>A framework is a full CSS stylesheet that you can reference on your own site.  It allows
	you to not have to worry about the elemental stuff of your site, as these details have
	already been worked out within the framework.  You <em>do</em> have to learn the framework,
	though, and how to reference these elemental stylings. The pro would be speed and
	consistency.  You can build out a site fairly easily by referencing pre-made styles.  The
	cons are that you have to learn the docs, instead of learning css--in addition, you'll be
	potentially  making a site that looks like anyone else's site made within that framework.
	That's an issue I had with bootstrap even before I knew what exactly it was.  I could tell a
	bootstrap site without looking at the code, based purely on aesthetics.  So the speed and
	consistency can also lead to boring sameness.</p>
	<h2>What is a wireframe, and why do we use it?</h2>
	<p>A wireframe is a sketch of how you'd like your site to look, using the "boxifying"
	philosophy of web design.  It's a nice way to gather your thoughts around the general
	structure of your site, what content you'd like it to have, and how you'd like folks to
	navigate this content.  Wireframes also help visualize how the site will look on mobile and
	then <em>extend</em> into desktops.</p>

	<h2>About the Wireframes</h2>
	<p>They acted as a good symbolic start to the site.  The thing I found most difficult were the circles.  I couldn't find a way to do them easily in CSS that was also responsive (and quick).  It seemed like the best way would be through some sort of SVG.  Simple border radiuses weren't working for me, and seemed to require a bunch of media queries for each different possible screen size.  So I wasn't able to do the central navigation exactly as I wanted, but I think the idea (nice colors, chunky graphics, simplicity) came through.</p>
