	<h1>c3 Meditation Process</h1>
	<h2>How did Process over Product affect the way you tackled the site?</h2>
	<p>I felt this concept helped me know when to stop working on the site, <em>for right
	    now</em>, even if it feels ugly or unfinished.  I understood that the point was not to
	have an incredible portfolio site, but to learn about frameworks and grids and try them out
	through the medium of my portfolio site.  I, personally, am unhappy with the aesthetics of
	my site.  It looks way too amateurish and child-like to me.  But through this I learned more
	about frameworks, and the grid style class, and flex boxes, and so on. I also learned of
	things I didn't have time to do (like get good at making an SVG).  It was hard to not just
	tinker on my site forever, or to avoid feelings of disatisfaction when comparing the site to
	other portfolios....but I remembered i'm in week 3 of my 18 week process, and I have time to
	learn, refine, and make something I'm proud of.  This epiphany helped me finish the week in
	a way I was proud of.</p>
	<h2>What did you think of Meditation, before SIY Ch. 2?</h2>
	<p>I thought it was great and essential for life.</p>
	<h2>What new things did you learn about meditation?</h2>
	<p>To be honest, not much new as it's already a large part of my life.  I did learn that
	a decent amount of people seem to require a scientific basis and rationality for it, before
	they'd even attempt it.  This was a large part of Meng's tone, which did not reach me
	personally, but seems to help reach his intended audience.</p>
	<h2>Did anything stand out to you?</h2>
	<p>I liked that he advised specifically for setting intentions.  That's one of the most
	powerful things you can do, I think, and it was cool to see it a part of his process.</p>
	<h2>Any other musings?</h2>
	<p>I'm excited for Phase 1(2?), when we are all in a group together, to see what our group
	mindfulness practice is like, or how we can support each other in both coding and
	consciousness.</p>
