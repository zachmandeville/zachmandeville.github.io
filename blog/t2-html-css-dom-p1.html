				<p>Part of the assignment for Sprint 2 was to visit various sites within [CSS Zen
				Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com) and record the ones I found appealing, or with elements I'd
				like to use in my own site.  From this, a few major themses for <em>my  aesthetic</em>, appeared:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li><b>Simplicity</b>:  If a site had a bunch going on, and large detailed images, I was not interested
				  in even clicking past the thumbnail.  The ones that did appeal to me were stylized, but the styles
				  were higly graphic and mostly changes in color or simple shapes.</li>
					<li><b>Bold Graphic Elements</b>: My favorite version of the site was 'mid-century design' which reminded
					  me of some De Stijl art--it had thick lines, and explicit shapes, and felt like the aesthetic was
					  in the structure and function of the site, similar to brutalist architecture.  I also really loved
					  that there was still play within these elements.  Boxes would move past the screen and bleed into
					  new sections, or overlap with other boxes and create an interesting blended color.  There didn't
					  seem to be anything hidden, and at no point was it made to not look like a website, but there was
					  cleverness in the web elements they used.  </li>
					<li><b>Sequential or Comic Elements</b>: There was an abstract narrative within 'mid-century design' that
					  I dug, where chunks of color would lead the eye into the next section of text.  This narrative
					  quality was even more explicit in the 'Museum' style, where each paragraph was contained within a
					  comic panel drawing of a museum, with patrons looking up at the text contained within an art
					  frame.  This sequential style allowed for the sites to still be simple, and functional, but feel
					  lively--it was encouraging movement from the reader within the page.  I also liked when heavily
					  stylized text was used as headers for the more traditional, and readable, paragraphs.  <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/193/">Leggo My
					  Eggo</a> did a great job at that. Side Note: I looooooved Wiggles the Wonderworm, as a concept, but found myself not too engaged with it as a
					  site because it felt more like they just uploaded a pdf.  So I think I like when something is
					  graphic, and sequential, but still feels like an explorable web page.</li> 
					<li><b>BIG FONTS, CENTER STAGE</b>: Lastly, I loved when the font was _big_ and prominent on the page.
					Some of this may have been due to it being an older site, but a lot of the styles had everything hug
					the left of the page real small.  It made the site feel broken and not welcoming to me.  I much
					preferered when something was even overly large, and inviting you to scroll through. </li>
				</ol>
				
				<h2>HTML, CSS, Javscript Analogy</h2>
				
				<p>These pages are using forms of language to communicate soemthing from the webmaster to the site
				visitor.  And so, I'm drawn to an analogy of a conversation, and a web page is a story that we are
				telling the visitor.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> HTML is the basic elements of a story (&#8220;I went to the store and saw a dog shopping for
					  groceries.&#8221;)</li>
					<li>CSS are the adverbs, adjectives, asides, and other assorted bits of color that make the story
					  interesting (&#8220;I went to the grocery store and saw a the cutest black lab, looking all serious and
					  business-like, shopping for dogbones with a shopping basket in his mouth.&#8221;)</li>
					<li>Javascript is the body language and other cues from the listener, that helps determine how you
					  <em>tell</em> the story.  It's the subtle input they give to the storyteller(&#8220;I went to a grocery store,
					  the one on....ah I can see that doesn't matter, but I saw a dog--what kind of dog?  A black lab,
					  like Cynthia's pup--buying groceries witha  shopping basket in his mouth!  Hahaha, your eyes are
					  wide, you don't believe, me, but I took a picture.  Look!&#8221;)</li>
				</ol>
				  
				<h2>Boxifying Design</h2>
				
				<p>The Udacity course talked a lot about "boxifying" the design, with different techniques for how you
				can boxify favorite websites.  What they mean is that, within the structure of a page everything is
				technically a box.  You can have nested boxes, and boxes next to boxes, and boxes of different
				colors, but they will always be a box.  Even when you see circles and triangles and other shapes
				within a site they will either be an image of a circle placed in a div box, or the div box altered
				through css to appear _as_ a circle.  By knowing this, you can more easily analyze a website into
				it's blocked, boxed, parts.  Even if one is flowy and highly stylized, the structure beneath will be
				a series of boxes.  So you can study the source code and see how the webmaster stylized the boxes to
				achieve this flow.</p>
				
				<h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>
				
				<p>The box model refers to the various components of a box element, and how they affect that element's
				shape and size.  These components are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The Margin: or the space around the element</li>
					<li>Border: the edges of the element, which can be made visible or invisible, and different levels of
					  thickness.</li>
					<li>Padding: the space between the border of the element and the beginning of the content within the element.</li>
					<li>Content: the content.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The spacing dimensions you pass on to the padding, border, and content will affect the overall box's
				shape and size.  The spacing dimensions you pass onto the margin will affect how far apart this
				element is from other elements on your page. </p>
