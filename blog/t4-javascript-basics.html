	<h1>t4 Javascript Basics</h1>
	<h2>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
	<p>HTML and CSS organize deal with notions of place, and Javascript adds the element of
	time.  With HTML and CSS you are organizing your content within a specific structure(the
	html), and this structure has a specific appearance(the CSS).  This creates a static page,
	that is sturdy within it's space regardless if anyone ever visits it.  Javascript adds the
	experiential quality to a page.  It takes in input from the user, and provides dynamic
	information back.  If HTML and CSS create the space, then Javascript creates the notion of
	how the space exists <em>Now</em>, and adds awareness of the visitor <em>to</em> that
	space.</p>
	<p>This is a beautiful, but problematic, notion as the visitor may not be aware that they are
	now a part of the experience, nor what part they are in or what the intention of the
	experience may be. </p>
	<h2>Explain control flows and loops using an everyday example</h2>
	<p>Control flows are the order in which a program executes the commands you've written for
	it.  A program is literal, and consistent: it does exactly as you asked, and interprets it
	in the exact same way and in the exact same order it's always interpreted it.  More
	practically, this means that when you write out a series of things you'd like your program
	to do, the exact wording for it is important and the order in which the commands appear is
	important as both control how the program interprets and experiences it.</p>
	<p>One way to think of control flows is the rituals you might follow when leaving your house
	in the morning.  For example, before I leave my house I run through a quick flow called "Do
	I have everything?" that, if run-through successfully, enables me to leave the house. The flow
	would look like this:</p>
	<ul><p>Do I have Everything?</p>
	    <li>Wallet</li>
	    <li>Phone</li>
	    <li>Keys</li>
	    <li><em>If the answer to each item is "Yes", this procedure completes and you may
		    confidently leave your house</em></li>
	</ul>
        <p>The order of this flow is specific, but in this case it's useful mostly as a memory device.
	However, as the flows become more involved, the order in which they're run through becomes
	crucial.  Take for example the larger flow of my morning called "Get yourself to Work":
	<ol><p>Get Yourself to Work</p>
	    <li>Run through "Do I have Everything?"</li>
	    <li>Leave house</li>
	    <li>Get in car</li>
	    <li>Drive to work.</li>
	</ol>
        <p>With this flow, if I decided to do item 2 first, I may find that I leave the house and get to
	the car but don't have my keys or wallet.  Now I can't finish the process (or get back into
	my house) and will have to run through my error flow of "Swear loudly at nothing then search
	for an unlocked window."</p>
	<p>For loops, they are flows you work through over and over for as long as some certain
	factor is present.  For example, let's say you're in your car to work and want to be a safe
	driver, so you might run through a "check your mirrors" loop.  This loop would be as simple
	as "For as long as there is a mirror I haven't checked, I'll check it!"  So when you run
	through this loop, it prompts you to check your rearview, your side mirror, and your
	passenger side mirror and then you can drive safe and secure until it's time to run through
	the loop again.</p>
	<p>In short, control flows and loops are ways we abstract cause and effect to work through
	what we consider a logical sequence of events.  This is (another) reason why diversity in
	tech is important.  If we are abstracting behaviors, and logical sequences, it'll be based
	on our view of the world.  I wouldn't want my above routine to be an actual program required
	to run, as it assumes I have a car(which I don't).  I would need someone to code it who
	understoodd the need for bus passes too, or know how to write that code myself!</p>
        <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays or from objects</h2>
	<p>An array is a list of things, while an object is sort of an array where each listed
	thing has a value.  It's sort of like someone giving you a list of books you should read,
	versus them handing you the actual books.</p>
	<h2>What are functions and why are they useful?</h2>
	<p>Functions are straight up magic.  With a function, you write down a word and then
	inscribe it with meaning--literally the things that are done when that word is spoken.  You
	can also add context for that word--things that you would want the spell cast upon or that
	would affect how the spell is cast.  Now that you've defined your spell, you can  call upon
	it throughout your code, where it will consistently perform the magic you asked of it.</p>
