        <h1>JS Language</h1>
	<h2>Describe these JS Language Use Cases!</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li class="bullet-free"><strong>Parentheses</strong>
		<p>Parentheses are a place to put in arguments for functions.  For example, if I
		have a function that adds a  class to an element, I could have the argument be the
		class I want added. This way, I can reuse the function for more than one situation:
		addClass('first-example') <em>or</em> addClass('second-example').  Functions require
		a space for an argument, but one doesn't need to be declared for the function to
		run.  And so addClass() indicates it's a function (cos it has that argument
		parentheses) but the class would be 'undefined'.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li class="bullet-free"><strong>Brackets</strong>
		<p>Brackets contain and navigate arrays.  var myArray = [] means the variable
		myArray is an array.  myArray[3] means I want to access whatever item is at index 3
		of the myArray array.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li class="bullet-free"><strong>Braces</strong>
		<p>Oh man, what can curly braces <em>NOT</em> be used for?  It seems like most of
		the javascript bugs you encounter can be fixed by adding or removing a curly
		brace.  They are intended to open and close functions, for loops, and while loops.
		They are like the opening and closing credits of a film, meant to indicate the space
		in which the narrative happens.  They are also used to declare objects in the same
		way you'd declare an array (var myObject = {})</p>
	    </li>
	    <li class="bullet-free"><strong>double quotes and single quotes</strong>
		<p>Quotes are used to contain a string.  They are also used for passing single word
		arguments, so that the computer knows the argument is the <em>name</em> of a thing,
		and not a variable called that thing.  In other words doFunction('cool') would pass
		along an argument entitled 'cool' to this function, while doFunction(cool) would
		pass on the variable called cool to this function.<p>
		<p>When you  have a string, contained in quotes, you would use the other type of
		quote to indicate some inner quote (quotes upon quotes!).  This lets the compute
		rknow you are quoting something, but are still within that which is string.  The
		type of quote you use for primary and secondary are based mostly on preference, and
		the preference of the code or team you are working with.</p>
