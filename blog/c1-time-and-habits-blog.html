			<p>Last night I spent an hour reading through the time-management
			techniques, and the blogposts about setting good habits.  I responded the
			most to meditation, and the counter-intuitive steps for productivity.  Some
			of these techniques seemed a bit more strategic than could be fit within an
			hour (for example, Pomodoro technique and the behavior setting lectures),
			but it was interesting to read about them. </p>
			<p>To be honest, I found myself reflexively at odds with these articles. I
			believe in the ideas present here, but have personal issue with the tone.  I
			wonder how much of this is an American cultural thing.  Within my community,
			especially among freelance employees, there's an obsession with boosting
			productivity and finding mindhacks.  Part of this obsession feels like
			survival-- you need to learn how to work on your own because traditional
			infrastructure has gone away.  On the other hand, it feels like ideals of
			capitalism seeping into ideas of self-worth.  For example, I love meditation
			and I love that it's the first article within the repo.  I think meditation
			is great for personal well-being.  And so I cringe when I see it being
			touted as a "lifehack"  to boost how much work you can do in a day.  I know that
			this is not Enspiral's focus, and that EDA is concerned with helping us
			becoming better people in general--but there's a whole other culture of
			co-opting spiritual health practices to increase the bottom line of a
			company.</p>
			<p>I think this is why I appreciated the "7 Counterintuitive Tips" article.
			While it had the structure of a business-speak medium post, the content was
			actually far more subversive.  The 7 steps were basically to protect
			yourself from people saying you needed to be more productive, and not
			letting you listen to your own cycles. The 7 tips seemed aimed at helping
			you be happier <em>with yourself</em> which might lead to more productivity,
			but really just leads to a better perspective <em>about productivity</em>.
			<p>It's also why I found myself checking out with the "Fogg Method".  I
			though the general idea of setting small behaviors to lead to larger habits
			was great-- but there's just something v. depressing to me about a person
			making a name for themselves as a productivity thought leader.  Fogg has
			spent years studying how to do more with a day, how to encourage healthy
			behaviors so you can increase your own abilities, and all this
			self-improvement and self-empowerment led to him....lecturing about
			self-improvement?  It feels like a guitarist learning the best and fastest
			way to tune a guitar, just so they can make an album of nothing but guitar
			tunings.  It reminded me of a story about Wittgenstein.  When he was
			teaching Philosophy at Cambridge, he was adamant that none of his students
			should become philosophers.  The best way to lead a philosophically rich
			life was to do a meaningful job.  His professorship was almost a burden that
			he wouldn't place on anyone else.  So he would mentor his brightest students
			to become carpenters, mechanics, doctors, and other socially 'lesser'
			jobs----but in this work you had a much stronger ability to actually
			<em>live</em> this philosophy you professed.  I wanted to learn from Fogg
			because of the incredible things he was doing, not about some "grid of good
			habits" he made.</p>
			<p>This post ended up surprisingly negative, and so one thing I want to
			experiment with is <em>why</em> this negativity is rising.  I think the way
			I'll experiment is with meditation, both through the restful awareness method and
			yoga.  I also really like the concept of timeboxing, because it feels kind
			of magic.  You are placing a circle around a section of time, and giving
			yourself protected space within this circle.  I dig with this hard, and so
			want to explore mindful, happy time-magic throughout this phase.<p>
